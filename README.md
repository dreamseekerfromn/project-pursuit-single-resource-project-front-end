# Alexander Tsiklids & Sung Yi's POSTR APP

## Overview

In the POSTR APP a user will be able to see and index of posts already created for our app, in addition to being able to create their own post as well.

A user will also be able to create a reply to a post, read replies to a post, delete a reply to a post, and/or edit a reply to a post.

Our POSTR app is comprised of two repositiories a front-end application that communicates with a back-end server to render the post and reply data.
